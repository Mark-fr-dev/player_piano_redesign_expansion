# Piano Player Project ‚Äî Daily Lab Notes
Date: 2025-09-25
Module: Piano bed and servo mounting structures

## Progress Today
- Reworked Params spreadsheet for tidiness; grouped parameters by category (keys, frame, servos, fasteners).
- Confirmed all parameters have aliases, so reordering won‚Äôt break references.
- Added horizontal positioning (dowel) holes to the "piano_bed" for alignment.
- Adjusted overall bedplate dimensions to fit within Prusa i3 build volume (250 √ó 210 √ó 210).
- Captured servo dimensions for SG90 profile and began setting up servo mounting geometry.
- Started decreasing material volume by adding pockets into the piano bed to reduce print time and filament cost.
- Started design of servo base plate, initially 3 mm thick, with awareness of balancing stiffness vs. print time.
- Discussed print-time/material tradeoffs (full plate ‚âà 9 h vs ribbed/segmented ‚âà 4‚Äì5 h).
- Confirmed workflow preference: add fillets as 3D features later in the tree, not inside sketches, for efficiency and robustness.
- Learned multiple ways to array cutouts (Sketcher Array, Part Design Linear Pattern, Draft Array).

## Next Steps
- Add vertical locating holes for stacking stability between layers.
- Test 3 mm servo base plate with ribs or flanges instead of pure thickness to save print time.
- Create parametric array of servo cutouts driven by `white_pitch`.
- Produce small coupon print (bolt + dowel cluster) to validate tolerances (~0.2 mm).
- Add fillet features at the end of body history for edges/pads.

## Design Notes (high-level rationale)
- One global Params spreadsheet will be used, with grouping by function (Keys, Frame, Servos, Fasteners). Local part-specific values can be added in separate sections.
- Dowels handle positioning, bolts handle clamping; clear separation of function improves assembly repeatability.
- Large flat plates risk long print times and wasted filament; ribbing strategy adopted to reduce cost/time while maintaining stiffness.
- Servo mounting will be split into two servo bars (white-key servos, black-key servos), both mounted to the servo base plate.
- Fillets applied at the feature level for cleaner sketches and easier future edits.

## File Updates
- Params.FCStd (spreadsheet restructured, all aliases set)
- Piano_bed.FCStd (added dowel holes, initial volume-reduction pockets)
- Servo_base_plate.FCStd (initial sketch, 3 mm thickness)
