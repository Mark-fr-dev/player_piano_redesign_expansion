# Piano Player Project — Daily Lab Notes
Date: 2025-09-25
Module: Piano_bed, Servo_plate, White_servo_bar

## Progress Today
- Completed lightening holes in the Piano_bed (circular array, parametric diameter/spacing).  
  → Purpose: reduce material volume and print time while maintaining stiffness.  
- Finalized horizontal and vertical bolt holes, dowel positioning holes, and push pads on the Piano_bed.  
- Completed Servo_plate with:  
  - Shaft holes for push rods.  
  - Mount holes and bosses for alignment.  
  - Servo mount tab slots sized for SG90 geometry.  
- Began White_servo_bar design:  
  - Captured key pitch from global parameters.  
  - Established initial spacing for servo cutouts.  
- Considered trade-off between custom lightening pockets (triangles) vs. simpler arrays (circles/rectangles) → settled on circular cutouts for efficiency and strength.  
- Reviewed FreeCAD workflow for arrays (Sketcher array vs Part Design Linear Pattern).  
- Confirmed strategy to keep sketches simple, with fillets and chamfers applied later as features.

## Next Steps
- Finish White_servo_bar geometry (servo slot dimensions, mounting holes).  
- Create Black_servo_bar with parametric offset relative to white keys.  
- Add vertical locating holes to Piano_bed for module stacking.  
- Test 3 mm plate + lightening holes vs ribbed reinforcement for print time/strength balance.  
- Export small coupon print (servo slot + boss + dowel) to test tolerances before full module print.

## Design Notes (high-level rationale)
- Lightening holes: chosen as circular for simplicity, robustness, and faster sketch/solve times compared to triangular pockets.  
- Bosses added to Servo_plate to strengthen mounting points for M5 screws.  
- Servo tab slots dimensioned from captured SG90 geometry (servo_width, servo_depth).  
- Servo mounting structure divided into White_servo_bar and Black_servo_bar to match key grouping, simplifying assembly and reducing print failures.  
- Parameter spreadsheet updated to drive new features consistently (bolt diameters, servo offsets, pitch).  

## File Updates
- Piano_bed.FCStd (added lightening holes, dowels refined).  
- Servo_plate.FCStd (completed shaft holes, bosses, tab slots).  
- White_servo_bar.FCStd (initial sketch started).
