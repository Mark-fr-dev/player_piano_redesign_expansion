# Piano Player Project — Daily Lab Notes
Date: 2025-09-24
Module: Piano Bed (1 Octave)

## Progress Today
- Designed the bedplate for one octave.
- Integrated horizontal and vertical bolt holes for fastening modules together.
- Added horizontal locating holes (dowels) for precise alignment.
- Added reinforced pads to transmit the piano push forces directly into the table surface, reducing stress on the frame.
- Confirmed overall geometry fits FreeCAD parametric structure.

## Next Steps
- Add vertical locating holes (to align stacked parts or cheek frames).
- Create white_key_bar and black_key_bar
- Create servo_base
- Work on the servo plate on which all the servos will be mounted

## Design Notes (high-level rationale)
- Pads: Avoid frame "walking" by transferring force vertically downward into the table.
- Dowels: Ensure repeatable alignment across octaves. Bolts handle clamping, dowels handle positioning.
- Dual fastening (horizontal + vertical): Supports both side-to-side chaining of octaves and vertical stacking of layers.
- Structure left simple for now — honeycomb infill will be handled by the slicer, not modeled in FreeCAD.

## File Updates
- Piano_bed.FCStd → new baseplate geometry.
- Design notes document updated with part-level rationale.
